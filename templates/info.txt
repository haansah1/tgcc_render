MUSINGS

I have learned that simplicity is a great key to achievement in life. Great people have learned to simplify their lives. Today, take stock of your life, offload every unnecessary baggage. Worry, fear, anger, bitterness, regret and condemnation will slow you down. Life is bigger than yesterday's pain. Today, shed off the load and travel light. May your helpers locate you and walk with you through your lonely valley. Joy is waiting!
